		- [911 Calls - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/911%20Calls%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.

  - __R__
		- [ISLR College Data](http://rpubs.com/FahimAJ/430084): In this micro project, we’ll use Decision Trees, and as well as Random Forests to classify schools as Private or Public based off their features. We’ll be using the College dataframe from the ISLR library.
